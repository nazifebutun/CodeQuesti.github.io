                When you examine the above code snippet, you can see how Java is structured. You see a class definition that starts with the expression public class. Then comes the main function. This function is the starting point of a Java program and is called first when the program is run. The System.out.println statement is used to print an output to the screen.
                 <br>Now it's your turn! <br>Before moving on to our first question, study this tip carefully and try to understand the basic structure of Java. This information will bring you one step closer to the treasure!
                 <br>Are you ready? So let's take a step into the magical world of Java and enjoy this adventure!
